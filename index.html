  <h1>Tardigrade</h1>

  <div class="intro">A tardigrade is a microscopic invertebrate animal that belongs to the phylum Arthropoda (insects, crustaceans, etc.). Tardigrades are often called water bears because they have eight legs and bear resemblance to bears. They are also known as moss piglets because they look similar to mosses. Tardigrades are commonly referred to as <span>“water bears”</span> because of their ability to survive in extreme conditions.</div>

  <h2>Water Bear</h2>

  <p class="bear"> The name tardigrade comes from the Latin word “tardus,” meaning “slow” and “gravis,” meaning ‘heavy.’ These animals are slow moving and heavy-bodied, making them well suited for survival in harsh environments. They are able to withstand extremely low temperatures, high pressures, and even radiation. </p>

  Survival

  <p class="desc">  They are able to survive in extreme environments due to their unique structure. Their bodies are covered in a tough exoskeleton composed of chitin, a substance found in insects and arachnids. This hard outer shell protects them from predators and helps them avoid dehydration.

    4. Extreme Environments

    Tardigrades are able to survive in some of the harshest environments on Earth. In fact, they can live in the vacuum of space without any problems. They can also survive in boiling hot springs, radioactive waste sites, and even inside nuclear reactors.

    5. Radiation

    Tardigrades can tolerate high levels of radiation. When exposed to radiation, they enter a state of suspended animation until the radiation passes. Once the radiation has passed, they return to normal activity.

    6. Dehydration

    Tardigrades do not need to drink water to stay alive; instead, they use moisture from the air around them. If they become dehydrated, however, they will die.

    7. Cold

    When exposed to cold temperatures, tardigrades will go into hibernation. While in hibernation, they lose weight and stop eating. After about two months, they wake up and resume normal activities.
